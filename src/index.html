                <h1>The magazine</h1>
                <p>
                    Escapism is the largest circulating independent travel magazine in the UK, with 81,988 (ABC verified) copies distributed free throughout London every month.</p>
                <p>
                    The magazine takes a fresh look at global travel, featuring inspirational writing from some of the most exciting voices in travel, and photography and design that transports readers from busy London streets to amazing locations across the globe.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In Escapism, we’re as likely to explore the street food scene in Seattle as we are to follow the exploits of a polar explorer, alongside the latest travel gear, news and trends, and guides that help readers see destinations from a new perspective.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We believe there should be more to going on holiday than just packing, getting on a plane and making a beeline for the nearest sunlounger. It should be fun, adventurous and life-changing. That’s why w e created Escapism – a magazine for travel lovers, made by travel lovers.
